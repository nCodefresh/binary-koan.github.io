Well, my courses have been going on for quite a few weeks now and my homework has been steadily
increasing, so this’ll be quite a short update on what I’ve been up to recently. Also, I have
something more interesting to tell of in an upcoming post. 

### Tokyo Tower

![The tower itself](1.jpeg)

I finally met up with one of my official buddies again to go to Tokyo Tower. This tower was
apparently built to look like the Eiffel Tower, except that for some reason it’s painted in stripes
of red and white. It’s roughly as tall as the Sky Tower in Auckland (for those who know New Zealand)
so although it’s nowhere near the tallest building in Tokyo you can still get some stunning views
from the top. Unfortunately it was cloudy that day, but you get the idea. 

![Weird when you’re 300m up and still can’t see the edge of the city in any direction](2.jpeg)

There’s also an aquarium and an amazing crêperie downstairs, along with the inevitable souvenir
shops and restaurants. 

![I love turtles anyway, but this has to be the coolest-looking one I’ve ever seen](3.jpeg)

### The Return to Hiroshima

Last summer I worked for Catalyst New Zealand on a piece of software called Mahara. Later, I was
surprised to find out that there a large number of people who use Mahara in Japan, and that they
have an annual conference. After having this fact brought to my attention by Catalyst, I ended up
going to this year’s Mahara Open Forum in Hiroshima. I was pretty nervous, but thankfully the
attendees were both informal and welcoming, so I had fun trying to talk software development in a
mixture of Japanese and pidgin English.

### Russian martial arts

Going to see a demonstration of Russian martial arts as part of some international relations stunt
is certainly one of the most unusual things I’ve done with the Aikido club. It was a great day out
though and fun to see some traditional Russian sports and costumes!

### Yokohama



It’s somewhere Jackie had been trying to take me for ages, but it was only a few weeks ago that we
finally made it to Yokohama. For those who don’t know, Yokohama is Tokyo’s port: Near the sea and
with plenty of interesting foreign influences. 

![And they say J. J. Abrams uses too many lens flares …](7.jpeg)

![So one of the things they have in Yokohama is a massive Pokemon store …](8.jpeg)

![And another is the Red Brick Warehouse (which is famous for some reason). Oh, and we happened to visit in the middle of Oktoberfest, so many sausages were eaten and much German beer was drunk](9.jpeg)

![Yokohama is perhaps most famous for its massive Chinatown, home to hundreds of $20 all-you-can-eat restaurants!](10.jpeg)

### Halloween



Apparently this is quite a big thing, at least in some parts of Tokyo. Unfortunately I had an Aikido
event the following morning so I couldn’t stay out as late as I would have liked, but it was still
fun being a dapper vampire (first chance I’ve had to wear my formal suit since arriving here) and
getting free drinks, free popcorn and free candyfloss in Shibuya. 

![Yay for panicking about where to find vampire teeth 2 hours before the party, then giving up and using Kiwi ingenuity to make them out of an ice cream container, Sellotape and an orthodontic retainer](11.jpeg)

Weird things 

- In a bar after the conference, I was introduced to the concept of “frozen beer”. Sadly it turned out
  to be normal beer with frozen foam on top rather than an actual beer-flavoured snow cone, but it
  was still a first for me 
- Escalators talk! Most don’t, admittedly, but the ones in the station I always use to get to work say
  things like “This is an up escalator bound for exit 3” or “This is a down escalator bound for the
  platform” when you step onto them
