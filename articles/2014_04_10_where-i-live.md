title: An end to the “A ___ of ___ and ___” posts
subtitle: Also, more about where I live!

Well, I said last week I’d write more about where I’m living so I’m sorry it’s taken so long. I also
received complaints from certain pedantic people that there were no pictures of flowerbeds in my
last post, so I’ve given up on the “A __ of __ and __” titles for now since they would just have
become even more contrived. 

I’ve just had my first day of classes (posts about the orientation and lectures and stuff will come
shortly) so I’ll also give you a quick photo tour of the university. This is also the start of the
barrage of macro photography which is likely to come throughout the year.

First, the place I live. It’s a dormitory/apartment type place where exchange students from many
different universities live. It’s called Azalea House, or azeria-hausu in Japanese. Yes, they have a
word for “azalea” and one for “house” but they still prefer to Japanise the English words. I can
only assume it sounds cooler to a Japanese person. 

Having talked to some of the other people here, it sounds like I’m lucky to have a 40-minute commute
to university. In fact, having talked to some of the people at university, it sounds like a
90-minute commute is quite normal here. That’s probably not surprising to some people but to me
(given that I’ve never lived more than 15 minutes away from school or university) it sounds
terrible! 

![Azalea House. It has vending machines and a bike rack outside as a matter of course; everyone cycles here and you’re never more than a 2-minute walk away from a vending machine](2.jpeg)

![This is Heiwadai (the surrounding suburb). More built up than most New Zealand suburbs, but still surprisingly, well, suburban for Tokyo](4.jpeg)

![Having said that, the city is never far away](5.jpeg)

![Tokyo strikes me as a rather beautiful city in a slightly haphazard, let’s-build-everything-we-can-think-of-and-see-if-it-works kind of way](6.jpeg)

As I’ve said, the university is about 40 minutes away, most of which is walking — the train only
takes 10 minutes to get most of the way, but it’s a 15-minute walk at either end. I was a little
worried about how much it would cost to commute (the trains aren’t really cost-effective for short
distances), but I now have a special student card which lets me travel to and from university for
free. 

The university itself is an interesting place. Pictures will be easier than words so I’ll shut up
(figuratively speaking) and let you read the captions.

![There’s cherry blossom everywhere on campus](8.jpeg)

![I’m not sure what this building is used for, but it’s pretty!](9.jpeg)

![The architecture here is fascinating — most buildings have arched windows and a slightly medieval style on the lowest floor and a “normal” modernist style for all the other floors](10.jpeg)

That’s about all I have time for now, but more posts about my recent exploits are on the way. There
are reasons why I haven’t posted anything for the past week! 

Weird things 

- Traffic lights are horizontal here, but the pedestrian stop/go signs are vertical. It’s probably
  copied from somewhere, but to my perfectionist eye it makes no sense — could they not just pick an
  orientation and stick with it? 
- My phone doesn’t work here so it’s strange not being constantly online. I even have to arrange to
  meet people at certain times in advance and assume they’ll make it on time rather than texting
  when I’m on the way! 
- In Japanese, “thank you” is “arigatou gozaimasu.” As you might imagine, that’s too long for most
  people to bother saying. However, it’s rarely shortened to “arigatou” (as I was led to believe in
  Japanese class) since that’s too casual for most situations — apparently mushing it into
  “agtzmasu” is a more appropriate thing to do 

And to close, a random Japanese word I learned today: shoten means “book shop”. The reason I’m
mentioning this is that I used to use honya (which has the same meaning) but found out today that it
makes me sound like a primary school student. According to my teacher I should be moving on to
junior high school level Japanese, so from now on I shall use shoten.
