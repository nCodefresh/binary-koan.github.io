  There's not a lot I've actually finished, but I have done a couple of websites
  for organisations in my hometown.

<h1>What I've worked on ...</h1>
<p>
  I'm a strong supporter of open source software and, while I don't have much
  experience yet, I have made a few contributions.

<h1>What I'm thinking about ...</h1>

  finish some of these!
