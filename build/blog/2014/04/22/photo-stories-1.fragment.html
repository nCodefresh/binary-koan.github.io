    <p>The macro shots in my previous post came from a day in Shinjuku Gyoen. My Japanese teacher
recommended it and as soon as I mentioned it to one of my new friends she organised a trip there. Or
maybe it was planned already since it turned out to be the birthday party of another (new) friend.
Either way, it’s definitely the most beautiful place I’ve been to so far. </p>

    <p>The day before, I’d been to a movie at Roppongi Hills, a fairly new district that includes art
galleries, shops, restaurants and the offices of various big companies (Google Japan, Konami,
Mitsubishi and more). The reason I spent an hour going there instead of ten minutes going to the
cinema in Ikebukuro was that I researched the logo and branding of Roppongi Hills a couple of years
ago for a design assignment. It was cool seeing the logo in context, and the buildings in Roppongi
(which were designed at the same time) are some of the coolest I’ve seen. </p>

    <p>I then returned a couple of days ago to go to Roppongi Art Night, an annual event where there are
artworks and performances in the streets and in the buildings from sunset on Saturday to sunrise on
Sunday. Unfortunately I’d been to a party beforehand and missed most of the performances, but it was
still fun to wander around looking at the installations with a few of the other partygoers.
Incidentally, if you ever need character inspiration for a story, get yourself invited to a Latin
dance party in the back streets of Tokyo. I can guarantee you characters galore. </p>

    <p>The next day I looked around Gokokuji (the area surrounding a famous temple) with one of the same
friends. It contains things like another beautiful garden, the largest cathedral in Tokyo and a
random house with cool flowerpots outside, but I’ll let the pictures speak for themselves. </p>

    <p>And finally, to cap off this ridiculously long and photo-filled post, I’ll leave you with one final
photo: Tokyo by night, from the 60th floor of the Sunshine Center in Ikebukuro. </p>

    <p>Weird things (only one this time, but it’s one I’ve noticed a lot) </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Japanese people will whip out umbrellas at the slightest hint of a drizzle and stare at me weirdly
if I don’t do the same. This is actually one instance where I don’t mind being stared at since it
saves me the trouble of a) remembering to bring an umbrella, b) bothering to get it out and c)
remembering and bothering to dry it when I get home </li>
    </ul>
