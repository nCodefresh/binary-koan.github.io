      <p class="subtitle">Kyoto — Japan’s most tourist-filled city</p>

    <p>Gakushuin’s summer holiday is drawing to a close, and I’ve been off travelling for quite a lot of
it. Kyoto isn’t the first place I went, but it’s the place it’ll be easiest to write about, so here
goes. </p>
    <p>I went alone, which I like doing occasionally simply because it gives me a chance to take hundreds
of photos without worrying about inconveniencing anyone else, so when I said “write” before, I meant
“throw photos together with minimal captioning”. But I think that’s the best way for you to get a
feel for the place anyway. </p>
    <p>But a small diversion before we get to Kyoto: I ended up staying with my girlfriend and her parents
for a night before leaving, and happened to arrive on the day of their town’s summer festival. It
was surprisingly similar to the annual Santa Parade in New Zealand cities, with stalls lining the
streets, various buskers and other street performers, and an army parade. </p>

    <p>I planned to go and see a famous castle upon arrival, but by the time I found my hotel (time which
included getting lost twice …) it was close to closing time. Instead I went to Heian shrine — not
something I’d planned to do, but still an interesting first place to visit. </p>

    <p>I was still feeling tired from the Aikido club camp (I’ll do an article about that as soon as I can
get photos off the club camera) so I went to bed early and planned for an early start. Unfortunately
I completely forgot to set an alarm, so I started considerably later than planned, but I at least
got up in time to see part of the morning. </p>
    <p><img src="6.jpeg" alt="My first destination was Kiyomizudera, a famous Buddhist temple" /><span class="caption">My first destination was Kiyomizudera, a famous Buddhist temple</span></p>

    <p>I rather suspect I was put off by the crowds before seeing the best parts of the temple, but
Kiyomizudera didn’t live up to my expectations (which were admittedly very high after glowing
recommendations from several friends). I hoped the other places I planned to see were more
impressive and less busy, and thankfully I was right. </p>

    <p>Feeling much happier, despite the continued crowds, I set off for what turned out to be my favourite
destination: Arashiyama. It’s a mountain on the outskirts of Kyoto which, in addition to more
shrines and temples, contains a monkey park and a bamboo forest, both of which I enjoyed immensely. </p>
    <p><img src="15.jpeg" alt="The selling point of the monkey park is that the monkeys are wild — they wander around without cages or barriers." /><span class="caption">The selling point of the monkey park is that the monkeys are wild — they wander around without cages or barriers.</span></p>
    <p>People are told to stay more than 3 metres away from the monkeys, but apparently no one told the
animals that — they’ll quite happily amble around and over your feet! </p>
    <p><img src="16.jpeg" alt="You’re not allowed to feed the monkeys outside, but if you go into a specially designed hut you can feed them peanuts or apple pieces.

    <p>That was the end of the second day; I’d planned to spend the third with a friend in Osaka but in the
end she wasn’t free, so I was able to spend an extra day exploring Kyoto (and explore at a leisurely
pace rather than the whirlwind tour I had planned). My first stop on the following day was the
castle that I had planned to visit on arrival: Nijoh-joh. It was built in 1626 as the Kyoto
residence of the Tokugawa shoguns, so it’s a bit like Windsor Castle in the UK (the “country house”
of the royal family). </p>
    <p><img src="19.jpeg" alt="Unfortunately you’re not allowed to take photos inside, but it really is a splendid place" /><span class="caption">Unfortunately you’re not allowed to take photos inside, but it really is a splendid place</span></p>
    <p>I was particularly looking forward to walking on the nightingale floors that are one of the
distinguishing features of the castle, but unfortunately the sounds are quite hard to hear with
noisy tourists everywhere! I guess they would be much more effective on a silent and moonless night
as a ninja, dressed in dark blue (not black — ninjas never wore black) stalks toward the shogun … </p>
    <p>It was also interesting seeing the different audience rooms, for the shogun to meet various classes
of people. These ranged from a small simple one (for minor nobles) to a large ornate one (for
important daimyo lords) to one decorated in reverse (for meeting the emperor or his messengers, the
only time the shogun wouldn’t be the most important person in the room). All the rooms had specially
designed screens and annexes to conceal the shogun’s bodyguards, and it was interesting to note that
the shogun would always be closer to his bodyguards than the people he was meeting. </p>
    <p>I was also pleasantly surprised how much of the Japanese explanation I could puzzle out — although
kanji characters are hard to learn, you can figure out a lot of unknown words if you know the
meanings of the characters they’re made up of. </p>
    <p>Lastly, since I still wasn’t tired of visiting temples, I visited Ginkakuji (the Silver Pavilion)
and Kinkakuji (the Golden Pavilion). </p>
    <p><img src="20.jpeg" alt="Ginkakuji is famous for its beautiful Japanese garden.

    <p>All of that made for a busy few days, but I’m glad I went. The sheer number of tourists actually
made me a lot more determined to speak Japanese; I felt I had to show I wasn’t an ordinary foreign
visitor. I’d like to try visiting Nara next time though — I’ve heard it has a similarly large
collection of temples and suchlike but isn’t quite so tourist-filled. </p>
    <p>Weird things </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I find it surprising that despite visiting countless temples, shrines and other religious sites
during the holidays, no one ever tried to convert me or even tell me about Shinto or Buddhism.
Which, oddly enough, actually made me want to learn more about the monks’ beliefs </li>
      <li>Japanese people buy an astonishing number and variety of charms and talismans compared to people in
Western countries—you can get premade charms for all sorts of things including exams, work, love,
pregnancy and general “domestic affairs” </li>
    </ul>
