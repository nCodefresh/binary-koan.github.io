# mingard.io
My personal website. It's built using a super simple static site generator,
written in CoffeeScript.

## Requirements
- Node.js, with the `coffee-script` package installed globally (for `cake`)
- Dependencies installed with `npm install`

## Tasks
- `cake build` builds the website for production (minifying stuff etc.)
- `cake server` builds the website, starts a server on port 8080 (for
  debugging purposes) and watches files for changes, recompiling as
  necessary

## License
I am offering both my code and writing to you under the MIT license in good
faith - enjoy :)
